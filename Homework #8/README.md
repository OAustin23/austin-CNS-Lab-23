## Research a Security Tool
### The security tool that I chose is Crackmapexec. This is refered to as a Swiss Army Knife for pentesting Windows/Active Directory environments. It can be used to enumerate logged on users, spider SMB shares, execute psexecstyle attacks and even inject mimikatz/shellcode/DLL's into memory using powershell. Crackmapexec was written in pure python script, and there is no external tools required. 
### This tool can be obtained from htttps://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/crackmapexec but it is already installed on kali. When the command "which crackmapexec" is run on kali, it returns "/usr/bin/crackmapexec"
### Apart from that, it is open source and fully available on Github (https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec).


## What does the tool look for or Examine?
###  This tool examines a whole host of protocols including: SMB, LDAP, WINRM, SSH, FTP, RDP,MSSQL and WMI.
